# Casino Roulette

## The Objective of the game 

* This program simulates a game of roulette. In roulette, a wheel spins and yields a number between 1 and 36 when a ball drops into a numbered slot. There are also slots numbered 0 and 00. These slots are green and each of the other slots is red or black. For the purposes of this program, assume that all odd numbers are black and all even numbers are red. In the real game, the colors black and red are distributed differently, but we will ignore that for the purposes of this program. Additionally, 0 and 00 are not considered either even or odd.

* In Vegas-style rules, gamblers can make several different kinds of bets, each of which pays off differently as listed in the table below.  These payoffs are close to the real mathematical odds of getting such a spin, but slightly lower to allow the casino to make a profit on average.

* A payoff of 1 to 1 pays even money: a bet of  $10.00 earns the gambler $10.00 if the bet wins.  On the other hand, a payoff of 17 to 1 means that a bet of $10.00 earns the gambler $170.00.  If the gambler loses, no money is paid out and the bet is kept by the casino.
